    "# Nurse Scheduling\n",
    "### Demo from  https://github.com/dwave-examples/nurse-scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a demo of a nurse scheduling model developed by Ikeda, Nakamura\n",
    "and Humble (INH).\n",
    "\n",
    "The nurse scheduling problem seeks to find an optimal assignment for a group of\n",
    "nurses, under constraints of scheduling and personnel. INH developed a model\n",
    "which is a simplified representation of a real-world nursing facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the general nurse scheduling problem, there are three types of constraints,\n",
    "which are mentioned here to provide background for INH's constraints.\n",
    "These types of constraints, in the general problem, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Both upper and lower limits on the number of breaks.\n",
    "2) The number of nurses on duty for each shift slot.\n",
    "3) For each individual nurse, upper and lower limits on the time interval\n",
    "   between days of duty.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three types of constraints combine to ensure sufficient nurses\n",
    "on duty at all times, without overworking any particular nurse.\n",
    "\n",
    "INH formulated a QUBO from a simplification of these constraints, discussed\n",
    "below, that tries to achieve reasonable results for nurse scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "INH's three types of constraints are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) \"hard shift\" constraint: requires that at least one nurse is assigned for\n",
    "   each working day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) \"hard nurse\" constraint: requires that no nurse works two or more consecutive\n",
    "   days.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) \"soft nurse\" constraint: promotes that all nurses should have roughly\n",
    "   even work schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo seeks to obtain reasonable results for a nurse schedule, based on\n",
    "INH's model. Our implementation attempts to find a schedule for a number\n",
    "`n_nurses` of nurses and a number `n_days` of days that satisfies the following\n",
    "conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One, and only one, nurse has been assigned to each day (hard shift constraint)\n",
    "* No nurse works two days in a row (hard nurse constraint)\n",
    "* The nurses should work the same number of days\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the demo results in the following output, at the command-line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Building binary quadratic model...\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending problem to hybrid sampler...\n",

    "* One, and only one, nurse has been assigned to each day\n",
    "* No nurse works two days in a row\n",
    "* Two nurses work 4 days, and one works three days. Because two nurses work one\n",

    "## Code Specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes on the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We use a two-dimensional QUBO matrix, Q[`i`, `j`], in which both indices `i`\n",
    "  and `j` are composite indices. Each composite index is used to represent the\n",
    "  combinations of the variables `nurse` and `day`. The (`nurse`, `day`) tuples\n",
    "  are placed into the one-dimensional index in the following order, where\n",
    "  `nurse` is first index, and `day` is second index, in the tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  (0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2)... (0, D) (1, 0) (1, 1)... (1, D)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The methods `get_index` and `get_nurse_and_day` are used to convert back and\n",
    "  forth between (`nurse`, `day`) tuples and the composite indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The three constraint sums are separated out in order to be able to confirm the\n",
    "  individual effects manually. For example, if a nurse was assigned to two\n",
    "  successive days, the hard nurse constraint sum would be nonzero.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have not yet confirmed Ikeda's results with reverse annealing"
