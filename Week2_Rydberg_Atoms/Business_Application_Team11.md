# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application of Unit-Disk Maximum Independent Set for Protein Folding

Unit-Disk Maximum Independent Set (UD-MIS) is an NP-hard problem represented as a graph optimization problem. The graph has a constraint that the distance between two vertices should be greater than a unit distanceâ€”this constraint models multiple real-world issues ranging from atomic physics to the communication industry. As the UD-MIS problem is NP-hard, many real-world problems with the domain constraint can be mapped into this simple model: wildlife distribution and packing, for example. Rydberg atoms naturally carry the model Hamiltonian of UD-MIS that can simulate the corresponding optimization problem. In this report, we propose applying the UD-MIS-Rydberg-Atom simulator to protein folding optimization processes.                    

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

By mapping the optimal cell phone tower problem to a quantum annealing problem of a spin Hamiltonian via the UD-MIS representation, we were able to find the optimal cell phone tower configuration.  

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Example: protein folding, wildlife distribution, packing problem (e.g., wood- glass- paper- industries), optimal CCTV locations, optimal distribution of franchise stores or warehouses, etc.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

Examples: 
- pharmaceutical company
- government
- franchise company
- wood- glass- paper- industries

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
