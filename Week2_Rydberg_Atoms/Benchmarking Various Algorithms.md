In this study, we compare computation performances across a number of classical and quantum algorithms for the UD-MIS (unit disk - maximal independent set) problem.
Classical methods include simulated annealing, an approximation algorithm based on subgraph-excluding subroutine (using the software [igraph](https://igraph.org/python/))[1] and an exact solution based on backtracking efficient search (using the software [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/))[2]. The simulated quantum method we study here is simulated quantum annealing based on neutral atom systems [3,4]. 

## Simulated Annealing

Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a certain function. The algorithm mimics the annealing procedure in metallurgy, where slowly cooling a material from a high temperature will allow material to eventually reach a stable ground state. At different temperatures, material systems can be found in different states with probabilities determined by the state energy and the Boltzmann distribution. In simulated annealing, at at certain 'temperature', variables can take different values with probabilites determined by the cost function at those values and the Boltzmann distribution. Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to simulate this probabilistic distribution. The temperature decreases gradually from kT = 100 Joule to kT = 0.01 Joule, where k is the Boltzman constant. The cooling rate decreases exponentially as the system gets colder. At each temperature step, the variable explores different values; it either accepts or rejects the new value with a probability determined by the current tempeature. The number of explorations is equal to the number of vertices in the graph. Here is an example of simulated annealing result for solving the UD-MIS problem.

We first study the effect of cooling speed by varying the number of steps in simulated annealing. More steps corresponds to a slower or finer cooling process. Ideally, we should cool the system infinitely slowly so the system can reach equilibrium at each step, which will eventually gives us the global optimal answer. However, we want to run our algorithm more efficiently by speeding up the cooling process with the risk of not getting to the global optimum. Therefore there is a tradeoff between running time and result accuracy. As shown below, we vary the number of steps from 5000 to 10 and run annealing repeatly on the same randomly generated graph containing 200 vertices, and we tried two different u parameters. The blue curves represent the linear reduction of running time, and the orange curves represent the size of the MIS (maximal independent set). The optimal MIS size is 93 for the graph and we see the algorithm starts deviating from the optimal solution when the number of steps is <1000. So 1000 steps is optimal in this case for both u values.

Next, we study the effect of the u parameter. u is the penalty factor to avoid selecting vertices closer than unit length. When u is too small, the algorithm is more likely to include more vertices in the set while ignoring their unit disk overlapping. When u is too large, the penalty term dominates. The algorithm will choose an independent set, however it may not be the largest/maximum independent set, as the first term in the cost function is negligible. u also determines the energy landscape of the cost function, hence affects the energy evolution during annealing. As seen in the following plot, when u is large, the slope between optimal and non-optimal configurations is so steep that the system can reach the optimal solution much faster. We fixed the number of annealing steps to be 2000 when varying u, and a large u more likely results in suboptimal set.
