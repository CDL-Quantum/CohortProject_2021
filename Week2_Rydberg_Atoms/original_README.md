## Project 2: Optimization problems \& Rydberg atom arrays

This project will guide you through using the foundations of quantum hardware to demonstrate a quantum advantage in real-world problems.

Open up [instructions.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week2_Rydberg_Atoms/instructions.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

**Please edit this markdown file directly with links to your completed tasks and challenges.**

## Tasks include:
* Simulating the unit-disk maximum independent set (UD-MIS) problem using classical simulated annealing.
* Finding a better annealing schedule to arrive at solutions to the problem quicker.
* Simulating the same problem but using quantum annealing.
* Comparing the classical and quantum methods.
* Solving a real-world problem involving cell phone tower placement in Gotham City.

## Further Challenges:
* Comparing the methods used to solve the UD-MIS problem.
* Benchmarking other quantum and classical optimization methods to solve your UD-MIS problems.
* Demonstrating how other problems can be mapped to UD-MIS and solving said problems.
* Solving the problem with real quantum hardware.

## Business Application
For each week, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

* Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
* Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
* Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
* Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.
