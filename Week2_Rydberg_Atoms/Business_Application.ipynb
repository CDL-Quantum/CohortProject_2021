    "Our company focuses on very simple problem. Can salesman travel without too much headache? Often time salesman needs to decide where to go to make most profit. Seems very small problem, but it is the problem that many business and organization need to solve in order to make scalable business and make optimum decisions. Where to build next Starbucks to optimize the benfits in Newyork? how many cell phone tower we need to cover the United states? and where to locate tornado shelter to save more people in the city in Oklahoma. Unfortunately, this problem is proven to be NP hard problem, and many scinetists are still trying to optimize nowadays. \n",

    "We all have seen the rise and fall of subway restaurants as they expand their franchiese aggressively. This is the common mistake that many business often fall into. Having too many franchieses in certain location can often cause negative revenue if the location and traffic is not optimized. This will not only reduce company's revenue, but reduce the local franchiese owner's failure rate and influence the product quality. To avoid such failure, we provide optimize with factors such as human traffic, population density, and landprice by changing the potential of the each atom (which is shown in figure with different circle radius). This information can be helpful to decide elimination of franchiese and planning for new area to optimize the revenue and minizie the risk. Company can use the knowlege to make decision which can save company's time and money. "

    "Beside optimizing multiple locations of the Franchiese, our solution can be very effective if we want to open up new franchiese for given location. For example, unlike Starbucks in Manhattan, Oklahoma does not have many starbucks. Therefore, there are many possible place that local owner can start the business. To optimize the best profit in Oklahoma, Starbucks can optimize the possible location. This can be simply done by contraining our hamiltonian with given location, and we can optimize the point of interest. This will help the company to detect the rich location faster than other compedator in the field. "
