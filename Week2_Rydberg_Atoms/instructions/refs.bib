	abstract = {Platforms of Rydberg atoms have been proposed as promising candidates to solve some combinatorial optimization problems. Here, we compute quantitative requirements on the system sizes and noise levels that these platforms must fulfill to reach quantum advantage in approximately solving the Unit-Disk Maximum Independent Set problem. Using noisy simulations of Rydberg platforms of up to 26 atoms interacting through realistic van der Waals interactions, we compute the average approximation ratio that can be attained with a simple quantum annealing-based heuristic within a fixed temporal computational budget. Based on estimates of the correlation lengths measured in the engineered quantum state, we extrapolate the results to large atom numbers and compare them to a simple classical approximation heuristic. We find that approximation ratios of at least \${\textbackslash}approx 0.84\$ are within reach for near-future noise levels. Not taking into account further classical and quantum algorithmic improvements, we estimate that quantum advantage could be reached by attaining a number of controlled atoms of \${\textbackslash}sim8,000\$ for a time budget of 2 seconds, and \${\textbackslash}sim 1,000-1,200\$ for a time budget of 0.2 seconds, provided the coherence levels of the system can be improved by a factor 10 while maintaining a constant repetition rate.},

	abstract = {The manipulation of neutral atoms by light is at the heart of countless scientific discoveries in the field of quantum physics in the last three decades. The level of control that has been achieved at the single particle level within arrays of optical traps, while preserving the fundamental properties of quantum matter (coherence, entanglement, superposition), makes these technologies prime candidates to implement disruptive computation paradigms. In this paper, we review the main characteristics of these devices from atoms / qubits to application interfaces, and propose a classification of a wide variety of tasks that can already be addressed in a computationally efficient manner in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era we are in. We illustrate how applications ranging from optimization challenges to simulation of quantum systems can be explored either at the digital level (programming gate-based circuits) or at the analog level (programming Hamiltonian sequences). We give evidence of the intrinsic scalability of neutral atom quantum processors in the 100-1,000 qubits range and introduce prospects for universal fault tolerant quantum computing and applications beyond quantum computing.},

Here we demonstrate a method for creating controlled many-body quantum matter that combines deterministically prepared, reconfigurable arrays of individually trapped cold atoms with strong, coherent interactions enabled by excitation to Rydberg states. We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary. Our method provides a way of exploring many-body phenomena on a programmable quantum simulator and could enable realizations of new quantum algorithms.},

	abstract = {Motivated by far-reaching applications ranging from quantum simulations of complex processes in physics and chemistry to quantum information processing, a broad effort is currently underway to build large-scale programmable quantum systems. Such systems provide unique insights into strongly correlated quantum matter, while at the same time enabling new methods for computation and metrology. Here, we demonstrate a programmable quantum simulator based on deterministically prepared two-dimensional arrays of neutral atoms, featuring strong interactions controlled via coherent atomic excitation into Rydberg states. Using this approach, we realize a quantum spin model with tunable interactions for system sizes ranging from 64 to 256 qubits. We benchmark the system by creating and characterizing high-fidelity antiferromagnetically ordered states, and demonstrate the universal properties of an Ising quantum phase transition in (2+1) dimensions. We then create and study several new quantum phases that arise from the interplay between interactions and coherent laser excitation, experimentally map the phase diagram, and investigate the role of quantum fluctuations. Offering a new lens into the study of complex quantum matter, these observations pave the way for investigations of exotic quantum phases, non-equilibrium entanglement dynamics, and hardware-efficient realization of quantum algorithms.},
