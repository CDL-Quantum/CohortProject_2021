## Use Case 2 : Resources Management

### Introduction 

Access to clean water is a human right, but water resources are becoming scarce, there's a global water crisis on the horizon [1]. People struggle to access the quantity and quality of water they need for drinking, cooking, bathing, handwashing and growing their food. We propose to optimize the position of water distribution locations in a city to maximize their use and manage an equal distribution in the population. 

### Explanation of the problem in the city of Tijuana and the associated solution
A humanitarian crisis is coming to the city of Tijuana in Mexico [2]. Lack of water has become the norm in the city and is expected to worsen in the coming year . Right now, the response of the government has been to cut the supply of water in specific neighborhoods for days, weeks, or months [3]. The consequence is an unequal distribution of the water in the city.

We propose detecting possible distribution points with a given radius of range for a division of the water cuts more efficiently. On the map, we can see a toy example of these points. Each circle is a zone with water.
