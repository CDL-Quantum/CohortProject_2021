Team 8 Alex Khan, Theo Cleland, Henry Makhanov, Ehsan Torabizadeh, Darshit Mehta

In this project we are going to demonstrate the amazing power of classical and quantum annealers. Throughout a series of tasks we will demonstrate the existing annealing techniques to solving a variety of problems. Crucially, we will show a solution to the unit-disk maximum independent set (UD-MIS) problem using both a simulated classical annealer with different schedules and a quantum annealer. For the third task, we have also solved the Gotham City Cell Tower problem using both classical annealer and quantum annealer. Finally, we have mapped a real-world protein redundancy problem to the UD-MIS problem and found very promising results that will serve as a founding block for our business proposal.

## Simulating the UD-MIS Problem Using Classical Simulated Annealing

Please view [this notebook](./Task1.ipynb) for the code used to solve this section. 

We simulate the UD-MIS using classical simulated annealing for the following abstract graph (truncated to 2 decimal places). Edges are created whenever a node is closer than a unit distance of 1.

|Table Representation of Graph | Visual Representation of Graph|
| :--------------: | :---------: 
| <table>   <thead>   <tr> <th>X Coordinate</th>  <th>Y Coordinate</th>  </tr>   </thead>   <tbody>   <tr>  <td>0.35</td>  <td>1.50</td> </tr> <tr>  <td>0.63</td>  <td>2.58</td> </tr> <tr>  <td>1.39</td>  <td>2.16</td> </tr> <tr>  <td>0.66</td>  <td>0.67</td> </tr> <tr>  <td>0.87</td>  <td>3.39</td> </tr> <tr>  <td>1.16</td>  <td>1.08</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> | ![Unsolved Graph](./resources/task1-graph-fixed.png)

Next we simulate annealing to solve the ground state of the following Hamiltonian:

$$
H = -\sum_{i \in V} n_i + u \sum_{i,j \in E} n_i n_j
$$

With the following annealing schedule: 
$T_i * (T_f/T_i)^(t/N)$

We find a ground state energy level of `-3` after about 4000 iterations. We plot in the following corresponding occupations in green which yield the ground state:

## Finding a Better Annealing Schedule

Please view [this notebook](./Task1.ipynb) for the code used to solve this section. 

We test 3 different annealing temperatures summarized by the following table (left) and visualized in the follow plot (right): 

| Table of Different Annealing Schedules | Plots of Each Annealing Schedule |
| :--------------: | :---------: 
| <table>   <thead>    <tr> <th>Annealing Schedule</th>  <th>Name</th>  </tr>    </thead>   <tbody>    <tr>  <td>T_i * (T_f/T_i)^(t/N)</td>  <td>exponential ~x (benchmark)</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>T_i * (T_f/T_i)^(2*t/N)</td>  <td>exponential ~2x</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>T_i * (T_f/T_i)^(4*t/N)</td>  <td>exponential ~4x</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table> | ![Visualization of Annealing Schedules](./resources/visualization-of-annealing-schedules.png) |

To test the speed of convergence, we consider a "stable" solution one where the energy has not changed after 100 iterations. After simulating the annealing for each schedule, we plot the energy versus the number iterations in the following table:

![Annealing Schedule Comparison](./resources/task1-annealing-comparison.png)

We see clearly that the `exponential ~4x` schedule converges the fastest, and is more than 3x faster than the benchmark provided in the sample code. These results are further summarized in the following table:

| Annealing Schedule   | Iterations to Stable Solution | Time to Stable Solution (seconds) | 
| :------------- | :----------: | :----------: |
| exponential ~x (benchmark) | 3676 | 0.61 |
| exponential ~2x  | 2007 | 0.34 |
| exponential ~4x  | 1044 | 0.17 |

## Gotham City Problem

This work was generated from [this notebook](./Task%203,%20Additional-Challenges%20b,%20d-ak.ipynb). The goal was to map the UD-MIS problem to a real world problem relating to finding optimal placements for cell phone towers in the city of Gotham.

We are given the follow nodes representing the position of cell phone towers:

|Table Representation of Graph | Visual Representation of Graph|
| :--------------: | :---------: 
| <table>   <thead>   <tr> <th>X Coordinate</th>  <th>Y Coordinate</th>  </tr>   </thead>   <tbody>    <tr>  <td>1.19</td>  <td>4.25</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>2.71</td>  <td>3.48</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>1.19</td>  <td>3.51</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>2.00</td>  <td>3.38</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>1.12</td>  <td>2.86</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>1.70</td>  <td>2.42</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>2.36</td>  <td>2.54</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>1.52</td>  <td>1.48</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>2.15</td>  <td>1.54</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>2.14</td>  <td>1.87</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>1.72</td>  <td>0.86</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>2.29</td>  <td>0.87</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table> | ![Gotham Nodes](./resources/gotham-nodes.png)

Our goal is to optimize the cell locations of each tower to best cover Gotham City, while only purchasing the required number of towers such that the tower signals do not overlap and as much of Gotham City is within signal range. 

### Why can this problem be mapped easily to the UD-MIS problem?

The requirements of the problem to maximize the tower coverage (use as many nodes as possible) and that the signal range not overlap (penalize node pairs with some condition) fits the UD-MIS formulation:

$$ H = -\sum_{i \in V} n_i + u \sum_{i,j \in E} n_i n_j $$

### Solve Gotham City's Problem

We solve this problem in four ways using a simulated classical annealing approach, a quantum annealing algorithm as well as on real quantum hardware using Microsoft QIO and D-Wave.

#### Simulated Classical Annealing

Running the algorithm on a simulated classical annealing algorithm yields a lowest energy level of -5. We reached convergance after about 3700 iterations using the default cooling schedule $T = T_i * ((T_f/T_i) ** (t/N))$. We plot one solution in the following figure in green:

![Graph with Solution](./resources/gotham-nodes-with-solution.png)

#### Quantum Annealing

Next we also run the same algorithm quantum-ly.

#### Real Quantum Hardware: Microsoft QIO

Repeated runs on Microsoft QIO gave the same answer as the simulated quantum annealing approach.

This solver (similar to most simulated annealing solvers) seems to give only one answer. It did not appear to be probabilistic and so, we did not see the value in proceeding any further with this algorithm.

#### Real Quantum Hardware: D-Wave

We also solve this problem on real quantum hardware using D-Wave. Here, we found multiple solutions with the same lowest energy of -5. We display the top solutions found in the left, along with an awesome GIF displaying each solution on the right (green nodes are occupied).

We also show the graph representation of the problem in D-Wave (left), the actual embedding on D-Wave 2000Q (middle) along with the energies sampled from Dwave (right).

#### New Formulation of the Problem

The UD-MIS formulation where the range overlap is descretized does not give solutions that would indicate the optimum solution since a large overlap and a small overlap both have the same penalty (higher energy of +1).

Thus a modified solution is found with a different solver (D-Wave) which uses the equation:

$$ f(x) = \sum_{i} {Q_{i,i}}{x_i} + \sum_{i<j} {Q_{i,j}}{x_i}{x_j} $$
As can be seen, in this solver the coefficient $Q_{i,j}$ can be used to indicate higher penalty for higher overlap.

We will use $Q_{i,j}=1/D_{ij}$ We also use the energy of each tower as -3

Using this formula and the execution below, we get the following best energy solution of -9.513712 using D-Wave. Although, note that this solution was only found 1 time with 100 samples. We notice that even with the new formulation, only 5 towers are needed. 

With this formulation, we get a sampling given by the following two figures. On the left, we show the sampling from D-Wave and on the right, a similar GIF as above displaying the various solutions.

| ![Gotham Dwave Energy Levels](./resources/image%20b32.png)| ![Gotham Dwave energy solutions](./resources/Gotham%20Solutions%202.gif) |

From D-Wave, we also show the resulting qubit embedding (left) and energy spectrum (right):

### Should Bruce pay for a few more cell towers?

No. As the full set of solutions show, we can have from 5 to 7 towers and still have the lowest energy of -5.

Adding an additional tower will add to the capital cost of adding a tower, however, there is no additional benefit based on the current formulation.

We would have to do an marginal analsysis and look at the incremental cost of each additional tower and compare to the incremental coverage area for adding the additional tower.

With the current threshold based binary UD-MIS formulation it is not possible to get this level of information.

Even when modifying the problem, we did not find a better solution with more towers.

## Finding Non-Redundant Protein Sequences

We take this project one step further by solidifying our business case with a real application: finding the least redundant set of proteins from real data! See [this notebook](./real_world_protein_redundancy.ipynb) for the implementation. 

Qamino strives in finding non-redundant protein sets to enable our customers to efficiently produce drugs without having to waste time experimenting with proteins that have already been tested. We test our algorithm on data found from the [Dali Protein Structure Comparison Server](http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/). [Our data](./protein_similarities.csv) is a matrix of the "similarity" scores between 59 different protein sequences. Here are the following protein sequences we investigate:

`1bksA,  3f2bA,  2yb1A,  3e38A,  2anuA,  3qy6A,  1v77A,  3dcpA,  3au2A, 1m65A,  2a3lA,  2qpxA,  3iacA,  1j5sA,  1itqA,  4mupB,  4dlfA,  2ffiA, 3irsA,  3cjpA,  4dziC,  2gwgA,  4ofcA,  4hk5D,  4qrnA,  2dvtA,  3gg7A, 2y1hB,  2vc5A,  2ob3A,  3k2gB,  1bf6A,  1a4mA,  2ogjA,  1a5kC,  1yrrB, 3nqbA,  2vunA,  1onxA,  3pnuA,  3giqA,  3griA,  3e74A,  4b3zD,  1gkpA, 2imrA,  3ooqA,  3icjA,  2oofA,  4c5yA,  3mtwA,  3mkvA,  4cqbA,  1k6wA, 4rdvB,  2uz9A,  2pajA,  3ls9A,  1j6pA`

To formulate this problem as a UD-MIS problem, we simply need to construct the edge matrix based on the similarity values from the [Dali Protein Structure Comparison Server](http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/). To do so, we must choose a good threshold to consider an edge. We use the following histogram to arbitrarily determine the best threshold. We chose a threshold of 25 indicated by the red dotted line on the histogram. On the right, we show the graph created (node positions are randomly assigned).

| :--------------: | :---------: |
|![Protein Similarities](./resources/protein-histogram-take2.png) | <img src="./resources/protein-case-graph.png" style="margin-bottom:55px">

We then solve the UD-MIS problem using a clasical simulated annealing schedule T_i * (T_f/T_i)^(t/N) where T_i = 100 and T_f = 0. We find a ground state for an energy level of -28. We plot the corresponding energies per iteration (left) and the graph solution in green (right) in the following figures:


| Energy Values | Graph Visualization |
| :--------------: | :---------: |
| ![Protein Energy History](./resources/protein-energy-history.png) | <img src="./resources/protein-solution-graph.png" style="margin-bottom:25px"> |

The solution set yielded from the classical simulation found 28 non-redundant proteins at a ground state energy of -28:

`1bksA, 3f2bA, 2yb1A, 3e38A, 2anuA, 3qy6A, 1v77A, 3dcpA, 3au2A, 2a3lA, 2qpxA, 3iacA, 1itqA, 2ffiA, 3irsA, 3cjpA, 4dziC, 2gwgA, 2y1hB, 2vc5A, 1a4mA, 2ogjA, 1a5kC, 1yrrB, 3pnuA, 2imrA, 3ooqA, 3icj`

#### Implementation on D-Wave

Since our company name is Qamino (standing for Quantum Amino), we needed a solution using real quantum hardware as well! Thus we tested this out using D-Wave. We were able to find the -28 energy ground state (although it was only sampled once out of 100 samples). We display graph representation of the problem in D-Wave (left), the actual embedding on D-Wave 2000Q (middle) along with the energies sampled from Dwave (right).
