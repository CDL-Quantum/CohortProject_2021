## Project 2: Optimization problems \& Rydberg atom arrays

This project will guide you through using the foundations of quantum hardware to demonstrate a quantum advantage in real-world problems.

Open up [instructions.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week2_Rydberg_Atoms/instructions.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

## Solutions


## Tasks include:
### Task 1: Simulating the unit-disk maximum independent set (UD-MIS) problem using classical simulated annealing.
In this task we tried several different schedules as suggested in citation [1] to see their effect on the convergence of UD-MIS under simulated annealing. We were able to find the ground state energy, which converged at an energy of -3. As we decreased the temperature, we found that the monte carlo algorithm converged faster as expected, and below is a graph demonstrating that result:

### Task 1: Finding a better annealing schedule to arrive at solutions to the problem quicker.
In this task we tried several different schedules as suggested in citation [1] to see their effect on the convergence of UD-MIS under simulated annealing

### Task 2: Simulating the same problem but using quantum annealing.
We constructed an arbitrary N vertex graph, Hamiltonion for our system based off UD-MIS problem and ran a simulated annealing algorithm on it to find the lowest energy state.   In the [Task 2 Notebook](./Task_2.ipynb) in Julia we tested variations of the annealing time division and shots to sample solution to the problem and graph them.  We then compared the "best" or lowest energy returned with the most commonly returned solution.  Here only nodes within a unit distance are drawn with connected edges since they are the only ones that can overlap.

The most common sampled state had an energy of -2.65

The sampled state with lowest energy has an energy of -5.0

* Comparing the classical and quantum methods.
### Task 3: Solving a real-world problem involving cell phone tower placement in Gotham City.

## Further Challenges:
* Comparing the methods used to solve the UD-MIS problem.
* Benchmarking other quantum and classical optimization methods to solve your UD-MIS problems.
* Demonstrating how other problems can be mapped to UD-MIS and solving said problems.
* Solving the problem with real quantum hardware.

## Business Application
For each week, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

* Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
* Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
* Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
* Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.
