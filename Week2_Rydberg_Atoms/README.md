## Solutions


## Tasks include:
### Task 1: Simulating the unit-disk maximum independent set (UD-MIS) problem using classical simulated annealing.
In this [Task 1 notebook](./Task_1.ipynb) we tried several different schedules as suggested in citation [1] to see their effect on the convergence of UD-MIS under simulated annealing. Below are two graphs, graph before simulated annealing is ran (Right) and graph after simulated annealing is ran (Left), note that the maximum independent sets are seen in yellow color.

We were able to find the ground state energy, which converged at an energy of -3. As we decreased the temperature, we found that the monte carlo algorithm converged faster as expected, and below is a graph demonstrating that result:

### Task 2: Simulating the same problem but using quantum annealing.
We constructed an arbitrary N vertex graph, Hamiltonion for our system based off UD-MIS problem and ran a simulated annealing algorithm on it to find the lowest energy state.   In the [Task 2 Notebook](./Task_2.ipynb) in Julia we tested variations of the annealing time division and shots to sample solution to the problem and graph them.  We then compared the "best" or lowest energy returned with the most commonly returned solution.  Here only nodes within a unit distance are drawn with connected edges since they are the only ones that can overlap.

![Most Common Sampled Solution](../Week2_Rydberg_Atoms/img/common.png)

The most common sampled state had an energy of -2.65

![Most Common Sampled Solution](../Week2_Rydberg_Atoms/img/best.png)

The sampled state with lowest energy has an energy of -5.0

* Comparing the classical and quantum methods.
### Task 3: Solving a real-world problem involving cell phone tower placement in Gotham City.

## Further Challenges:
### Method Comparision Between Classical Simulated Annealing vs. Quantum Annealing in the UDMIS Problem

### Benchmarking Criteria: Classical vs. Quantum Optimization for UD-MIS
**Theoretical Background**: During this simulation, we utilized the simulated annealing algorithm to solve the UD-MIS problem. Let n<sub>i</sub> be the gap between the largest and second largest eigenvalues of a stochastic matrix M<sub>i</sub>. Let n = min<sub>i</sub>n<sub>i</sub>. The run time of this alogirthm is proportional to O(1/n) [1][2], and it has been shown that quantum computers can increase the efficieincy by O(1/√n) [1][3]
