## Project 2: Optimization problems \& Rydberg atom arrays
Optimization is a crucial element used in solving problems across many different fields, 
from scientific to industrial applications, to generally boost performance and reduce risks.

Recent advances in both quantum hardware and algorithm development have made it possible to solve small problems on modern
quantum devices. In particular, quantum computing has potential to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems,
especially showing an advantage when dealing with NP-hard problems [1]. 

One of the quantum computing models which can solve combinatorial optimization problems
is the Adiabatic Quantum Optimization model (AQO). AQO refers to the use of the adiabatic 
theorem in quantum mechanics [2] to adiabatically (i.e. slowly) move towards the ground 
state of an interaction Hamiltonian onto which an optimization problem is mapped. 
As a result of the adiabatic theorem, the state of the system after the adiabatic evolution will be 
the ground state of the final Hamiltonian, i.e. the global minimum of the optimization problem mapped onto the 
final Hamiltonian.

In the following we address the solution of a well-known NP-hard problem, the Unit Disk Maximal Independent Set 
(UD-MIS). We first modified the provided Jupyter notebook for the solution of the problem with the classical 
simulated annealing. Further, we prepared two more notebooks: in the first we perform a quantum annealing 
simulation in Julia; the second provides a python implementation of quantum annealing which uses
the D-Wave Ocean SDK to compare the classical simulated annealing to the quantum simulator and finally 
perform the optimization on a real D-Wave quantum device.

## 1. The UD-MIS problem: 
In the MIS problem we consider a graph with a set of vertices, V, and a set of 
edges, E, G = (V,E), and we want to find out what is the maximal number of vertices 
which may be "colored" such that no two colored vertices are connected by an edge.

The UD-MIS is a special case of this problem in which we consider a graph in which
each vertex corresponds to the center of a unit circle and we connect these vertices
with an edge if and only if the corresponding circles intersect.

The problem of finding the MIS can be expressed as a quadratic unconstrained optimization problem,
which is also equivalent to an Ising hamiltonian

![CDL 2020 Cohort Project](../Week2_Rydberg_Atoms/img/ising_hamiltonian.png)

where the quadratic terms favours disjoint circles and the linear term makes sure
that we select as many circles as possible.

This problem can easily be mapped onto a Rydberg atom architecture as the hamiltonian
of this system is equivalent to the one shown in the UD-MIS problem.

In the following we present several solutions for the MIS problem, both from a
classical and a quantum standpoint.

### 1.1 Classical simulated annealing
The simulated (thermal) annealing is a heuristic optimization procedure which spans the solution 
space of a generic optimization problem by simulating the physical process of heating a material 
and then slowly lowering the temperature to decrease defects, thus minimizing the system energy.
Each transition in spanning the solution space is called anneal.

### [ELI/SAESUN]: 
can you add the analysis you performed in this section? 



* Finding a better annealing schedule to arrive at solutions to the problem quicker.

### 1.2 Quantum annealing
Quantum annealing has been introduced in the 80s as a variation of the simulated thermal annealing
for solving NP-hard optimization problems. The main difference is that besides the thermal
excitations used in simulated annealing to span the solution space, the quantum annealing 
incorporates quantum transitions (tunneling), making it more efficient in converging towards the 
ground state of the system. Later it was proposed to actually use a quantum system to
implement the quantum annealing algorithm. The company D-Wave Systems was the first to build a 
prototype QA processor and to start the commercialization of these devices, using then quantum annealing algorithms 
on quantum hardware.

Besides the D-Wave systems, different quantum architectures have been used to 
implement quantum annealing. Recent developments in the quantum hardware with trapped neutral atoms 
showed that the latter can be a useful tool to implement adiabatic quantum computation. 
In this architecture, 

Rydberg atoms are atoms with highly excited electrons, far away from the nucleus (i.e. large principal quantum number). 
Compared with ground state atoms, they exhibit a very large electric dipole moment which facilitates strong interactions 
with macroscopic external fields. Thus, this makes Rydberg atoms easy to control with static electric or magnetic, 
laser, or microwave fields which is then ideal for implementing controllable quantum many-body simulators.

In particular, the Rydberg hamiltonian has the same functional form as the QUBO hamiltonian
used to solve the UD-MIS problem. 
![CDL 2020 Cohort Project](../Week2_Rydberg_Atoms/img/ising_hamiltonian.png)
where the linear term is responsible for the interaction of each atom with the external field,
and the quadratic term is the interaction between two Rydberg atoms.

The concept of quantum annealing can then be applied to such a system to find the ground
state of an optimization problem that can be mapped to the hamiltonian of the Rydberg atom system.

The analysis we performed is based on the extension of the provided 
[Julia code](../Week2_Rydberg_Atoms/run_quantum_annealing.jl).

The starting point is the same graph as provided in the previous section:
![CDL 2020 Cohort Project](../Week2_Rydberg_Atoms/Graphics/coordinate_plot.svg)

In this code, the quadratic and linear terms of the interaction hamiltonian are defined time-dependent functions 
such that at the beginning (t=0) one has a free hamiltonian, while by increasing time steps
the hamiltonian adiabatically changes into the final interaction hamiltonian which maps the 
problem that we want to solve. 

Based on the adiabatic theorem, if the transition to the final interaction hamiltonian is adiabatic,
the initial state will remain in the ground state across the whole adiabatic transofrmation.
The ground state of the final interaction respresents thus the minimum of the optimization problem
mapped onto the system.

By simulating a measurement of the final ground state a large amount of time, we obtained a
distribution of the results which shows that there are basically three degenerate solutions:
![CDL 2020 Cohort Project](../Week2_Rydberg_Atoms/Graphics/histogram_solutions.svg)

We selected one of the three solutions and we mapped it to a graph. In the space of the coordinates, 
the solution found is given by the graph below, where the blue circles correspond to the independent set
of vertices:

### add something on Comparing the classical and quantum methods.

## 2. Ocean SDK: comparing simulation to a real quantum device
D-Wave Systems created a full-stack framework ([Leap2](https://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap)) to run quantum annealing algorithms on both simulators and real quantum devices. The access to their systems uses an API mechanism for which registration is required. As part of the CDL, all users should have got a license and can access the real quantum devices. 

For the simulation part, only requirement is the installation of the package [dwave-ocean-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/dwave-ocean-sdk/).
In [this notebook](./OceanSDK_implmentation.ipynb) we show how to build a graph for the UD-MIS problem and solve it by means of three different methods:
- simulated thermal annealing
- simulated quantum annealing
- quantum annealing on a real quantum device

The graph provided in the previous task is built with the [networkx package](https://networkx.org/). 
This is useful as the D-Wave library provides a wrapper to solve the MIS problem in this specific form.

The results from all implementation are equivalent. Note that also in this case we 
observed the problem intrinsic degeneracy, being the vertices 0, 3, and 5 equivalent (see figure below).
