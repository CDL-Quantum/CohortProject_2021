## Project 2: Optimization problems \& Rydberg atom arrays

This project will guide you through using the foundations of quantum hardware to demonstrate a quantum advantage in real-world problems.

## Code and Notebooks
For each of the sections below a notebook with the same name is associated. The task and challenges were taken from the following  [instructions.pdf](./instructions.pdf).


## Tasks 

### Task 1
associated [notebook](./Task1.ipynb)

* We solved the unit-disk maximum independent set (UD-MIS) problem using classical simulated annealing, for the proposed graph for the exercise. TODO Alice

* We try to find a better annealing schedule to arrive at solutions to the problem quicker.
TODO Felipe

### Task 2
associated [notebook](./Task2.ipynb)
* We solved the same problem but using quantum annealing, thanks to the Yao library instead.
TODO Alice

Both solutions are compliant and optimal according to the bruteforce comparaison

TODO Alice : Brutforce ?

### Task 3
associated [notebook](./Task3.ipynb)
* Solving a real-world problem involving cell phone tower placement in Gotham City.
TODO Alice


## Further Challenges:

* Solving the problem with real quantum hardware.

### Implementation on Dwave
associated [notebook](./Dwave.ipynb)
TODO Alice

### Implementation on IonQ
TODO Victor 

### mapping the Nurse Scheduling Problem to UD-MIS
* Demonstrating how other problems can be mapped to UD-MIS and solving said problems.
TODO Victor

### benchmarking the Nurse Scheduling Problem
TODO Felipe
* Comparing the methods used to solve the UD-MIS problem.
* Benchmarking other quantum and classical optimization methods to solve your UD-MIS problems.
