    "Quantum Strategy is a team of physicists, software engineers, and data scientists who help companies make improvements through technology particularly specialized in optimization algorithms and quantum computation. We empower the business and government by providing optimized solutions via calculating heavy and difficult problems with modern computers and quantum computers such as D-wave.\n",

    "Our company focuses on a very simple problem. Can a salesman travel without too much headache? Often time salesman needs to decide where to go to make the most profit. Seems very small problem, but it is the problem that many business and organization need to solve to make scalable business and make optimum decisions. Where to build next Starbucks to optimize the benefits in Newyork? how many cell phone towers do we need to cover in the United States? and where to locate a tornado shelter to save more people in the city in Oklahoma. Unfortunately, this problem is proven to be an NP-hard problem, and many scientists are still trying to optimize it nowadays.\n",

    "However, with recent innovations in quantum physics, a quantum computer can be calculated much faster than what the best super-computer can calculate. By taking advantage of that innovation, we are confident we can empower the company by the optimal and successful decision which can save millions of dollars."

    "We all have seen the rise and fall of Subway restaurants as they expand their franchises aggressively. This is the common mistake that many businesses often fall into. Having too many franchises in a certain location can often cause negative revenue if the location and traffic are not optimized. This will not only reduce the company's revenue but reduce the local franchise owner's failure rate and influence the product quality. To avoid such failure, we provide optimization with factors such as human traffic, population density, and land prices by changing the potential of each atom (which is shown in the figure with a different circle radius). This information can be helpful to decide the elimination of franchises and planning for a new area to optimize the revenue and minimize the risk. The company can use the knowledge to make the decision which can save the company's time and money. "

    "Besides optimizing multiple locations of the franchise, our solution can be very effective if we want to open up a new franchise for a given location. For example, unlike Starbucks in Manhattan, Oklahoma does not have many Starbucks. Therefore, there are many possible places that local owners can start the business. To optimize the best profit in Oklahoma, Starbucks can optimize the possible location. This can be simply done by constraining our hamiltonian with a given location, and we can optimize the point of interest. This will help the company to detect the rich location faster than other competitors in the field. "
