We have found a revolutionary way of severing chemical bonds in the methane molecule. For example, our innovative idea enables us to transform a gasous methane molecule into the radical CH<sub>3</sub> molecule. Our method gives an exact amount of light necessary to break down the methane molecule. This is particularly useful, because of the explosive nature of methane, breaking it down to an unstable methyl radical CH<sub>3</sub> will eliminate the potential harm of CH<sub>4</sub>. Methyl radical is a strong oxidant and reductant agent, that is quite corrosive for metals, but it is not particuraly useful. However, we aimed only to show a proof of concept.

We believe that breaking down molecules in this cost efficient manner can be used in wide range of commercial applications. More importantly, we believe that finding out vibrational excitations of molecules has important applications in the field of resource finding. For example, we can apply this method to find underground water reservoirs, which will be a crucial tool in combating water shortage. Looking into the future, this technology will enable a scan of asteroids that might carry water within their shell. Theoretically, the only limit this technology has is the number of qubits, so with a sufficiently powerful quantum device we can also apply it to find even more complex materials like petroleum. This can be a game changer for the energy companies, who are always looking for new oil sources to develop.
