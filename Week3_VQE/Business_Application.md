## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

In this week's exercise, we looked at some variational methods for the simulation of chemicals.
We focused on very simple molecules, because, as we saw, this problem can quickly become intractible on larger molecules.
We also stepped through the process of variational quantum eigensolving.
To do this, we wrote down a Hamiltonian description for a molecule, and translated this into a unitary evolution operator.
By applying this operator and measuring the results, we can simulate some rudimentary chemicals.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Chemicals are at the heart of several large industries. These include:
- Pharmaceuticals
- Mining
- Manufacturing
- Energy & water

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

**State and Federal Governments.** Toxic materials in water supplies are a major health risk. 
We could simulate potential toxic materials to assess their harmfulness.

**Airbus.** 
The common chemical reaction that leads to rust is a huge problem for production and quality assurance in
aeronautical engineering.
We could use quantum computing to simulate the oxidation process of metals.

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Rust is a silent, slow killer. 
Every year, commercial airlines spend time and money investigating rust. 
Using quantum computation, we will simulate the process of rusting and provide airlines with a fast, more efficient
means of studying rusting in their airplanes.
This cuts down on both time and money for the airlines.
