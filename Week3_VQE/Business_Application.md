# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consdier the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

A brief example for each question is included for the 
[Traveling Salesman Problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

Example: Finding a global minimum in settings where a classical approach may not be able to find a global minimum.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Example: A courier has to deliver parcels to several locations and is looking to minimize its travel time. (e.g., “the travelling salesman problem”).

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

Examples: 
- Federal Express
- Canada Post

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language
