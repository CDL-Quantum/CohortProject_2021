    "In this cohort project, we illustrate the VQE process using the IBM quantum computer. For Task 1, we first simulate the system with the classical algorithm. We repeat the example process of H2 and H20 molecules and generate more results for other molecules with four different methods. Hartree-Fock (HF), Configuration Interaction Singles and Doubles (CISD), Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD), and Full Configuration Interaction (FCI). Using the method, we obtain the ground state PES of the molecules both on a classical computer using classical methods and the VQE simulator. \n",

As we can expect, if the distance between Hydrogen inside of H2 or H4 became really large, we can safely assume that it will become signle hydrogen system. Since Hydrogen Eg= 0.49 Eh, so 4 x Eg= 1.9, which is very close with CCSD and FCI solution."

The bond length is 0.2 to 3 with 15 data points, and we calculate the difference and calculate the mean value of the error. As shown in the figure, CCSD shows quite good accuracy, but the HF method failed to converge to right solution. In particular method with ccpvqz, accuracy is drop to 54%. ccpdz with CCSD method shows the best accuracy. However, I suspect that ccpv5z will show better accuracy if I give enough time to calculate the solution."
