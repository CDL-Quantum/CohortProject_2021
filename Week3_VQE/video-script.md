We are LightQ. We design high quality, organic light emitting diodes AKA OLEDs for leading manufacturers in smartphones, laptops, tablets and handheld gaming consoles. We use state of the art technology to inovate this field, using quantum variational eigensolvers to determine the ground and excited energy states of industrially relavent molecules such as Tris(8-hydroxy-quino-linato)aluminium. This allows us to create thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters suitable for OLED application with 100% quantum efficiency. 

As the market for digital displays grow, leading manufacturers such as Apple and Dell need to keep up. Our solution ensures the most efficient displays for your product. We beat the competition, who are still using classical methods to develop their OLEDs. With the market nearing $60 billion dollar by 2025, you need the right manufacturers of OLEDs in your corner. Thats why we're here. LightQ.
