## Project 3: VQE: Constructing potential energy surfaces for small molecules

This project will guide you through the state-of-the-art techniques for solving electronic structure problems on NISQ computers.

Open up [instructions.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week3_VQE/Instructions.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

**Please edit this markdown file directly with links to your completed tasks and challenges.**

## Tasks include:
* Generating PES using classical methods.
* Generating the qubit Hamiltonian.
* Unitary transformations.
* Hamiltonian measurements.
* Use of quantum hardware.

## Further Challenges:
* How to obtain excited electronic states of the same or different symmetry?
* Partitioning in the fermionic operator space.
* Applying unitary transformations on the Hamiltonian.
* Compress larger basis sets into smaller number of qubits.

## Business Application
For each week, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

* Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
* Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
* Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
* Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.

For more details refer to the [Business Application found here](./Business_Application.md)
