## Project 3: VQE: Constructing potential energy surfaces for small molecules


# Task 1: Generating PES

The first task we were assigned with was to run PES calculations for $H_2$ and $H_2O$ molecules using popular quantum chemistry methods such Hartree-Fock (HF), Configuration Interaction Singles and Doubles (CISD), Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD), and Full Configuration Interaction (FCI), in the minimal STO-3G basis.
Subsequently we were asked to compute similar curves for other molecules $H_4$, $LiH$, $N_2$, and $NH_3$.
