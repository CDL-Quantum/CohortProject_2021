## Tasks include:
### Part 1: Generating PES using classical methods.
**Analysis:**
### Part 2: Generating the qubit Hamiltonian.
**Analysis:** For a qubit to a valid mapping to a fermion, it must preserve the anti-symmetrical nature of the fermion.
### Part 3: Unitary transformations.
**Analysis:**
### Part 4: Hamiltonian measurements.
**Analysis:**
### Part 5: Use of quantum hardware.
**Analysis:**

## Further Challenges:
### How to obtain excited electronic states of the same or different symmetry?
**Analysis:**
### Partitioning in the fermionic operator space.
**Analysis:**
### Applying unitary transformations on the Hamiltonian.
**Analysis:**
### Compress larger basis sets into smaller number of qubits.
**Analysis:**
