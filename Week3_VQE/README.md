## Project 3: VQE: Constructing potential energy surfaces for small molecules

This project will guide you through the state-of-the-art techniques for solving electronic structure problems on NISQ computers.

Open up [instructions.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week3_VQE/Instructions.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

## Tasks include:
### Part 1: Generating PES using classical methods.
**Analysis:**

### Part 2: Generating the qubit Hamiltonian.
**Analysis:** In this section, we were able to generate the qubit hamiltonian for the following molecules: H2, H4, LiH, H20, and N2. Due to the size of each hamiltonian, we wont directly write them (but they are generated in the netebook S2_Hamiltonian_gen.ipynb. For reference of how computationally difficult they are, we have listed the number of qubits required to specify each molecule.
