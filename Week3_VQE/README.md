# [Task 1: Classical Methods](./notebooks/1_classical_methods.ipynb)

For Task 1, we first simulate the system with the classical algorithm. 
We repeat the example process of H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules and generate more results for other 
molecules with four different methods: Hartree-Fock (HF), Configuration Interaction Singles and Doubles (CISD), 
Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD), and Full Configuration Interaction (FCI). 
Using these methods, we obtain the ground state PES of the molecules both on a classical computer using classical 
methods and the VQE simulator.

From the figure above, we show two different results: weakly correlated systems (H<sub>2</sub>, LiH) and strongly 
correlated systems (H<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, N<sub>2</sub>).

Since the classical algorithms can make a good approximation to the weakly correlated systems, we do not see 
any big diverging behavior throughout the inter-atomic distance. 
However, for the strongly correlated systems, we can see diverging behaviors, and we are often quite off from our 
exact solution (FCI). 

This effect is more noticeable with the case of H<sub>4</sub>, none of the points except the faraway distance shows 
correct energy estimation. 
This is because the H<sub>4</sub> system has more contribution from four hydrogens being correlated. 
On the other hand, the LiH system shows good converging behavior because of the stable system which does not perturb 
the system.

Unfortunately, we are not able to converge CISD method in our simulations.

### Among classical methods, there are techniques based on the variational approach and those that are not. Identify variational methods among those that were used and explain advantages of the variational approach. Are there any arguments for using non-variational techniques?

FCI method provides the exact answer because it scales exponentially with the number of basis functions; it models all
electron-electron interactions.
This is unlike the variational methods (HF, CISD, and CCSD) which consider an approximated version. 
HF is based on a simpler, non-interacting model. CISD and CCSD assume single and double excitation events.
Variational methods offer an approximation at the cost of accuracy, but non-variational methods become intractible when 
electron-electron correlations dominate.

### Check separability of HF, CISD, and CCSD by taking 2 H<sub>2</sub> fragments at a large distance from each other and comparing the total energy with 2 energies of one H<sub>2</sub> molecule. Explain your results.

| System\Method | FCI | HF | CCSD | CISD |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H2+H2 |  -1.86 | -1.09 |  -1.86 | x |
| H4 | -1.86 |  -1.09 | -1.86 | x |
| dif | 0 | 0 | 0 | x |

In the table above we show the energy of the H<sub>4</sub> and two seperate H<sub>2</sub> molecule, and show the 
difference between them. 
This shows that all methods (except CISD) have great separability. 
If the distance between H inside of H<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>4</sub> becomes very large, we can safely assume that it will 
become single H system. 

### Convergences along the second coordinate requires the basis set extension from STO3G to a series like cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, cc-pV5Z. Explore for a small system like H<sub>2</sub> both convergences. Which energies should be expected to be closer to experimentally measured ones?

| Basis\Method | HF | CCSD | CISD |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sto3g |  12.92 | 2.35E-6 | x |
| ccpdz | 9.35 |  1.30E-6 | x |
| ccpvtz | 19.13 | 2.33E-5 | x |
| ccpvqz | 45.74 | 2.66E-6 | x |
| ccpv5z | x | x | x |

We also have tried with other basis such as cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, cc-pV5Z. 
Unfortunately, ccpv5z takes too much time, so we could not converge the result. 
The table above shows =the energy difference between each method and FCI. 
We calculate the difference and calculate the mean value of the error. 
CCSD shows quite good accuracy, but HF failed to converge to right solution. 
In particular method with ccpvqz, accuracy is drop to 54%. 
The ccpdz basis with CCSD method shows the best accuracy. 
However, we suspect that ccpv5z will show better accuracy if we give enough time to calculate the solution.

# [Task 2: Generating Hamiltonians](./notebooks/2_generating_hamiltonians.ipynb)

In this task, we want to simulate the molecular system in a quantum computer. 
To do that, we need to find the way to simulate the Hamiltonian in quantum computer. 
This can be done by generating Hamiltonian in the second quantized form and mapping from fermionic operators to qubit 
operators. As illustrated in the instruction,

1. To proceed to VQE one needs to generate the qubit Hamiltonian, the easiest path is via first
generating the electronic Hamiltonian in the second quantized form and then transform it into the
qubit form using one of the fermion-to-qubit transformations: Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev.

2. Next, some qubit operators can be substituted by numbers (Â±1) because their states are stationary
for the specific electronic state (e.g. ground state).

### What are the requirements for a function of qubit operators to be a valid mapping for the fermionic operators?

In the Jordan-Wigner transformation, qubit operators must correctly reproduce the anticommutation relations that 
characterise fermions.
This is recovered by adding additional Pauli Z terms to each mapped fermionic term.
This makes the mapping nonlinear.
As a consequence, the Hamiltonian after a Jordan-Wigner transformation is non-local.

### What are the cons and pros of the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation compared to the Jordan-Wigner transformations?

The Bravyi-Kitaev Hamiltonian has far fewer terms.
By only considering the effective Hamiltonian, we can reduce the complexity of the problem which will greatly increase 
the accuracy of the calculation in a quantum computer.
The Jordan-Wigner transformation is more exact, but comes at a cost of decreased locality.

# [Task 3: Unitary Ansatz](./notebooks/3_unitary_ansatz.ipynb)

### Which of symmetries are conserved in UCC and QCC?

In UCC methods, our fermionic excitation terms conserve particle number *N* (we can only move fermions between levels, not destroy them) 
and spin-projection *S<sub>z</sub>* (we do not flip spins when hopping between orbitals).
If we also take the sum of a fermionic term and its Hermitian conjugate, we can conserve total electronic spin 
*S<sup>2</sup>*.

QCC methods can break all these symmetries for individual terms. 
However, though symmetries are broken at the level of individual terms, QCC should still conserve these symmetries 
overall.

### Why symmetries are helpful for constructing a unitary operator which rotates the initial state to the correct final state?

Roughly speaking, the symmetries put a constraint on the "allowed" transformations.
The unitary evolution between the initial and final states should commute with the operators that describe the 
symmetries of our system. 
This restricts the form of the unitary evolution. 

### What are the ways to restore symmetries if your unitary transformation break them?

It depends on the symmetry in question.
Consider total electronic spin *S<sup>2</sup>*. 
Fermionic excitation terms individually break this symmetry.
However, we can easily recover it by taking linear combination of an excitation operator and its Hermitian conjugate.
