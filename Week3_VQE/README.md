## Project 3: VQE: Constructing potential energy surfaces for small molecules

This project will guide you through the state-of-the-art techniques for solving electronic structure problems on NISQ computers.

Open up [instructions.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week3_VQE/Instructions.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!


### Generating PES using classical methods

*Advantages:*
-Variational methods provide a simple way to place at least an upper bound on the ground state energy of any quantum system
-These methods can be used to calculate excited states in certain situations, adding a penalty term to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian and then minimizing this sum

Variational methods are likely to **fail** for transition states or near dissociation limits of multiple bonds.
