## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

A Natural Language Processing can be trained to understand and judge a sentence 
or a proposition is true or false, meaning that the machine understands the context of sentences. 


## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

We can consider a simple real world application where incoming calls should 
be forwarded to designated department in a call-based service, such as 911 
emergency calls. 

911 emergency calls require immediate forwarding of the call to either police 
fire department to engage an attention from the handling department in the 
area,
while the call operator starts the conversation with the caller. 

The caller will report where s/he is calling from and what situation is 
involved. The statements for this kind of discussion can be very precisely
trained as the key words are limited to identify which local department is 
in charge. 

In the metropolitan Seoul area, Gangnam and Seocho are neighboring municipals
that share emergency calls.

We can consider a call classification by type of situation { accident, crime }
as well as by location { Gangnam, Seocho }.

From the initial conversation, a call-forward NLP machine can identify the 
call forwarding to 

- Fire dept in Gangnam
- Police station in Gangnam
- Fire dept in Seocho
- Police station in Seocho
 
in order to immediate responses of the dept in charge.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

This service will be highly valuable to all municipals as it can reduce 
a lead time to the adequate initial response in emergency situations.

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language
