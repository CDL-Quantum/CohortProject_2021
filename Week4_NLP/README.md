## E1
Our task was trying to generate Chocolate Mousse [Ref](https://www.recipetineats.com/chocolate-mousse/).

By swapping the white and yolk, we were able to get foam and choc cream. By combining two choc cream and foam, we were able to generate choc mousse. By far was we understand, this is the first generation of choc mousse in discopy environment. Previous research [link](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/05/06/crema-di-mascarpone-rules-of-the-game-part-2-and-diagrammatic-reasoning/) already showed generation of Crema di Mascarpone, but the challenge was obtaining Mascarpone in grocery store. Therefore, our work enhanced previous studies by utilizing more accessible product to create choc mousse in discopy environment. 


As we are preparing the choc mouse, we also replicate previous research on tiramisu generation, and successfully recreate multi-layer tiramisu with simple for-loop technique.

This diagram represents multi-layer structure of tiramisu, which can be easily replicate in average household. One of the main challenge of this work was that often requires large amount of eggs. This challenges was also integrated into our solution where we can easily scable the operation with N number of egg.

Our cascade and scalable egg york generation should resolve the challenges with large-egg process, and provide simple and compact solution for future multi-layer tiramisu generation. 

Another challenges for tiramisu generation was language barriers. Many of recipes are based on English, and there are many intererest building tiramisu in other platfrom in different language. As part of the localization project, we have delelope our unique french to English translation where we can trannslate the recipe into French.

Our research is funded by international tiramisu & choc mousse Association (ITCMA).
