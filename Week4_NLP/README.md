## Project 4: NLP: Natural Language Processing on a Quantum Computer 

### Task 1: Learning how to use DisCoPy

There are interesting exercises in qnlp tutorial!
We executed the introduced codes in tutorial
and provided answers to exercises.

Our answers can be found in
[qnlp-tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/QuNovaComputing/CohortProject_2021/blob/week4_qunovacomputing/Week4_NLP/qnlp-tutorial.ipynb).

### Task 2: Generating your own dataset

To run QNLP experiment, we made some simple sentences [sentences](https://github.com/QuNovaComputing/CohortProject_2021/blob/week4_qunovacomputing/Week4_NLP/sentence.txt)

### Task 3: Run your first QNLP experiment


With the sentences made in Task 2, we conducted an experiment.
We refer to [Task3](https://github.com/QuNovaComputing/CohortProject_2021/blob/week4_qunovacomputing/Week4_NLP/notebook.ipynb).







## Business Application
For each week, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

* Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
* Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
* Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
* Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.

For more details refer to the [Business Application found here](./Business_Application.md)
