Our uphill battle of learning QNLP through the exercises: https://github.com/uchukwu/CohortProject_2021/blob/rough_draft/Week4_NLP/qnlp-tutorial.ipynb

And the uphill battle was still steep as we got to next local maxima of the climb (hypothetically, challenge existed with dataset): https://github.com/uchukwu/CohortProject_2021/blob/rough_draft/Week4_NLP/notebook.ipynb

## Business Application
