# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

This week, we looked at natural language programming.
We constructed diagrams for simple sentences, and how the words in that sentence related to each other.
We then translated these sentences into quantum circuits, and simulated their output.
Based on their output, we were able to train a model that determined whether a sentence was true or not.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

In [this notebook](./notebooks/3_qnlp-experiment.ipynb) we looked at QNLP for relationship extraction.
However, a prominent real-world example of NLP is sentiment analysis; determining whether a sentence is positive or negative.
One of the most obvious applications is in finance, specifically investment.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

We are going to sell QNLP-driven financial sentiment analysis. 
Our customers are individuals and companies engaged in trading.

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Stock trading is quickly becoming a very popular past-time
People are more than happy talk your ear off it, and we are seeing this enthusiasm spilling over into social media platforms.
Sites like Reddit and Twitter becoming veritable goldmines of financial advice and discussion.
There's a lot of be gained there, but there's also a lot of data, at the end of the day, spending your days on these sites can be really draining.
Introducing **Geddit**, QNLP-driven financial sentiment analysis for stock trading.
Keep a healthy distance from social media while still benefiting from the great financial advice to be found there.
Our quantum-based algorithms will drive your trading to the next level!
