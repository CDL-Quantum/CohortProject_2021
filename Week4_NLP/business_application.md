# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

This week, we looked at natural language programming.
We constructed diagrams for simple sentences, and how the words in that sentence related to each other.
We then translated these sentences into quantum circuits, and simulated their output.
Based on their output, we were able to train a model that determined whether a sentence was true or not.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

A prominent real-world example of NLP is sentiment analysis; determining whether a sentence is positive or negative.
Other applications include relationship extraction (which we looked at in [this notebook](./notebooks/3_qnlp-experiment.ipynb)), and spam detection.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved


## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language
