Setuping Julia Environment:

1. Download Julia (For Mac users, brew install --cask julia)
2. Install IJulia which will create a Ijupyter notebook with julia compiler.
- Follow the instructions provided by IJulia https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl.
3. Install PastaQ, since pastaQ uses Itensor, we only need to install pastaQ

- type add PastaQ and hit enter
4. Once it finishes download, just enter the notebook() command in the julia REPL and you're good to go
