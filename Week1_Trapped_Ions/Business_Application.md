# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consdier the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

A brief example for each question is included for the 

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

We have implemented a circuit that can generate random bitstrings better than classical computers. 

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve
This solution will enable the creation of a quantum cryptocurrency because it creates bitstrings using quantum proof of work. Security of the ledgers that were created using quantum cryptocurrency can only be compromised by another quantum computer because quantum proof of work is computationally intractable for the classical computers. 

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

Examples: 
- Large financial institutions reliant on secure reserve currency
- Government of Haiti is a more concrete example, because of the forthcoming financial instarbility 

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language
