## 1. Quantum random circuits

A random quantum circuit is a random unitary operator (or gate) applied to a qubit system. Generally, this unitary gate 
can be built as the product of single- and multi-qubit unitary gates.  

Random circuits can be used to sample data from random distributions.
In particular, random circuits can be used to approximate the probability distribution P(x) and sample 
data from the approximated distribution. The closeness between the two distributions can be calculated by means of 
standard statistical metrics, such as the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence.

In 2018, Google proved that the sampling from quantum random circuits composed of 1- and 2-qubit gates 
outperforms the same task done on a classical computer ([Arute et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5)). 
Thus, Quantum Random Circuits clearly provide an advantage with respect to classical computers in producing samples 
based on a random distribution. 

Besides the advantage in the sampling from random distribution, Quantum Random circuits also provide a
way to produce a certified random number generation ([Jacak et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56706-2)). 
In fact, quantum systems exhibit true randomness, however the verification of true randomness of the generated 
number (aka certification) is not always possible. For instance, given a string of random numbers generated by a 
Hadamard gate, there is no way for a user to verify that these numbers are actually coming from a quantum device and that
there is no hacker who is actually just sending bits chosen in advance.
However, quantum random circuits provide a way to certify the generated random numbers. In fact, in case of an actual
quantum random circuit, the generated random bitsrings have high associated probabilities and that the linear cross-entropy
fidelity, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F_{XEB}">:

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F_{XEB}=2^N<P>-1"></p>

is high enough. The verified bitstrings can then be concatenated and hashed to obtain a certified true random bitstring.

## 2. Real-world problems which can be approached with Quantum Random Circuits

Both the efficient random distribution sampling and certification of random bitstrings can be applied to practical use 
cases and eventually improve the classical solutions. 

Certification is in fact a key feature of security systems. In fact, all classical systems use pseudo-random number 
generators (PRNG) based on an input variable called seed. Consequently, if a hacker were to uncover the seed, it would 
compromise the validity and security of the PRNG. 
Having a verifiable true random number generation is therefore crucial to the security of large financial institutions 
as well as governments to protect transactions or information. 

However, in most cases PRNG is still good enough as it’s executed server-side. On the other hand, in the blockchain domain
such the issue of hacking the seed for random generation is amplified by the transparent nature of the blockchain. In this 
case, true randomness for blockchain transactions, e.g. smart contracts and digital signature, is essential and 
certification via quantum random circuits can provide a way to improve the security of these transactions.

## 4. Business application pitch 

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
