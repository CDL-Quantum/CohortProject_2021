# Week 1 Quantum Cohort Project Business Application - Team 10

Team members: Alexander (Sandy) Bell, Na Young Kim, Sushanta Mitra, Ushnish Ray, Ming-Tso Wei

In this cohort projects, we solve four tasks related to the random quantum circuits with ITensor and PastaQ that can be applicable directly on the NISQ devices. We would like to apply this quantum advantage in the seismic signal processing for oil exploration business, which is one of the ten biggest Industries in the world and its annual market revenue would be around $3 trillion USD (https://www.investopedia.com/investing/oil-gas-industry-overview/). This would be particularly relevant for Canada as it is a national industry, being present in almost all provinces.

As a widely applicable technique, seismic technologies are exploited in the development of oil and gas production by constructing subsurface images both in two- and three-dimensions(https://gov.nu.ca/sites/default/files/2017_seismic_eng.pdf and https://dug.com/dug-insight/). Thus, it is required to collect enormous big data and interpret them correctly and efficiently. Seismic modeling is an inherently noisy process as such most models and interpretations can tolerate noise inherently present in the data. This provides a unique avenue for NISQ devices where noise related fidelity is a concern. With further investigation we will be able to ascertain the degree to which NISQ can contribute. By trading noise for the efficiency, our team believes that powerful quantum machines will outperform classical computing performance to handle massive seismic wave data efficiently and to reach correct interpretations for timely business decisions with optimal performance and economical benefits.
