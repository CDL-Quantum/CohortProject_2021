# Quantum Cohort Project Week 1 Business Application. Simulating quantum advantage with trapped ions

## Summary of the technical problems solved in the exercise

One of the possible foundation for gate-based quantum computers are trapped ions.

## Examples of real-world business applications built around sampling-based quantum computing with random curcuits

Example: A courier has to deliver parcels to several locations and is looking to minimize its travel time. (e.g., “the travelling salesman problem”).

## Potential cusomers in these areas

Examples: 
- Federal Express
- Canada Post

## Presentation of the value proposition of our innovation to the potential customer

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
