# Week 1 Quantum Cohort Project Business Application - Team 10

Team members: Alexander (Sandy) Bell, Na Young Kim, Sushanta Mitra, Ushnish Ray, Ming-Tso Wei

In this cohort projects, we solve four tasks related to the random quantum circuits with ITensor and PastaQ that can be applicable directly on the NISQ devices. We like to apply this quantum advantage in the seismic signal processing for oil exploration business, which is one of the ten biggest Industries in the world and its annual market revenue would be around $3 trillion USD (https://www.investopedia.com/investing/oil-gas-industry-overview/). In particular, it is Canada's national industry throughout almost in all provinces.

As a widely and common technigue, seismic technologies are exploited in the development of oil and gas production by constructing subsurface images both in two- and three-dimensions(https://gov.nu.ca/sites/default/files/2017_seismic_eng.pdf and https://dug.com/dug-insight/). Seismic data processing in oid and mining industries is not exact in nature and not necessary to be. Noises and errors are expected in the seismic data but the data volumes and processing requirement are huge in order to build up the tomography of the earth. Sound waves are sent through the earth and reflect back up from stratigraphic boundaries to geophones where the signal is recorded. A huge computing power is used to visualize the tomography in 3D. The real issue is the significant amount of noises in the signal. Due to the fact that geophysicists are working with (and expecting) errors in the data and that it requires the sheer computing power, our team believes that NISQ machines combined with classical computing may handle massive seismic wave data efficiently and reach correct interpretations for timely business decisions with optimal performance and economical benefits.
