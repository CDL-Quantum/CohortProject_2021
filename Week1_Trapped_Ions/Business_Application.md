# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consdier the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

A brief example for each question is included for the 
[Traveling Salesman Problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

In this project we have simulated a similar quantum advantage experiment to that performed by by Google in 2019. We have shown how this can ben achieved
on a gate set native to a trapped ion computer. We use MPS methods to efficiently simulate larger 
systems which provides a proof of concept for our approach. However, we were interested to see how these
results are affected by real-world decoherent noise processes.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

With so many new quantum hardware companies pushing different architectures, having a systematic means
for them to benchmark their hardware for the task of demonstrating advantage.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

Non super-conducting hardware providers such as:
-AQT
-IonQ
-Universal Quantum
