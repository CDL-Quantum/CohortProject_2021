# Quantum Cohort Project Week 1 Business Application. Simulating quantum advantage with trapped ions

## Summary of the technical problems solved in the exercise

One of the possible foundations for gate-based quantum computers is trapped ions. Here, we followed Google's notable demonstration of quantum computational advantage to simulate random circuits sampling for an ion-trap quantum computer. The performance of the current quantum computers is limited by noise and decoherence, so to account for that, we introduced errors in the individual gates. 

## Examples of real-world business applications built around sampling-based quantum computing with random circuits

**- Applied metrology for the slot machines**

Slot machines are the most popular gambling option in casinos. Their simplicity and the appeal of a game of fair chances attract customers resulting in about 70% of the average casino income in the US.

## Potential customers in these areas

**- Casinos**

**- Slot machines manufacturers**

**- Gaming Control Boards**

For the US, each state is governed by different regulations. As a result, agencies respective to each state in particular are operating within the borders, i.e. Nevada Gaming Commission and Control Board, New York State Gaming Commission and others.
