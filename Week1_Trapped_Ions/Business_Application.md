# Quantum Cohort Project Week 1 Business Application. Simulating quantum advantage with trapped ions

## Summary of the technical problems solved in the exercise

One of the possible foundations for gate-based quantum computers is trapped ions. Here, we followed Google's notable demonstration of quantum computational advantage to simulate random circuits sampling for an ion-trap quantum computer. The performance of the current quantum computers is limited by noise and decoherence, so, to account for that, we introduced errors in the individual gates. 

## Examples of real-world business applications built around sampling-based quantum computing with random curcuits

**- Applied metrology for the slot machines**

Slot machines are the most popular gambling options in casinos. Their simplicity and the appeal of a game of fair chances attract customers resulting in about 70% of the average casino income in the US.

## Potential customers in these areas

**- Casinos**

**- Slot machines manufacturers**

**- Gaming Control Boards**

For US, each state is governed by different regulations. As a result, depending on the state, you will find different agencies, i.e. Nevada Gaming Commission and Control Board, New York State Gaming Commission and others.

## Presentation of the value proposition of our innovation to the potential customer

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
