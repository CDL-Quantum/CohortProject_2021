## Project 1: Quantum Advantage with Trapped Ions 

This project will guide you through the recent Google quantum supremacy result, and its possible implementation using near-term quantum computers built with trapped ions.

Open up [instructions.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week1_Trapped_Ions/instructions.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

Please edit this markdown file directly with links to your completed tasks and challenges.  

## Tasks include:
* Simulating a random circuit with a Matrix Product State code, and producing a speckle pattern.
* Adding a single bit-flip error and exploring the change in the speckle pattern.
* Exploring convergence of the Porter-Thomas Distribution.
* Exploring the effect of 2-qubit gate errors.
* Describe a business that could be build around random circuits.  (See below Business Application)

## Further Challenges:
* Animate your speckle pattern.
* Reproduce the Google cross entropy results.
* Implement this circuit on a real trapped ion computer!


## Project submission
* In the [collected](https://github.com/edenian/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week1_Trapped_Ions/collected) folder you can find our solutions.
* We have also added several [helper functions](https://github.com/edenian/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week1_Trapped_Ions/collected/task_functions.jl).
* Additionally, we have also made a [pennylane implementation for task 1 and 2](https://github.com/edenian/CohortProject_2021/blob/main/Week1_Trapped_Ions/supremacy_pennylane.ipynb)
* Our business proposal [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14un0QcZAPzFebu80yCkA4NXwRZUjdDI_/view?usp=sharing) and accompanying [slide deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PaEO5x007ML564jlR8ytTPmc7rERudiU/view?usp=sharing)
