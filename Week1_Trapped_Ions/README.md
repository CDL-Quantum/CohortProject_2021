In this work we perform sampling of pseudo-random quantum circuit probability distribution using trapped ion gates simulated on a classical computer. We explore how the probability distribution depends on the depth (number of layers or gates) and width (number of qubits) of the circuit and how sensitive the resulting speckled pattern is to perturbations (errors in the circuit). Next we study the convergence of a perfect quantum random-circuit to a Porter-Thomas distribution and deviations from these distribution as the 2-qubit gate errors increase.

A very brief introduction to the main ideas behind the project are presented [here.](./Documentation_week1.pdf).

From the business perspective, we first provide a non-technical description of the problem, then we give our approach in tackling the challenge. We identify a potential business application describing the current market research, customers who would benefit from the quantum advantage. Finally we present a short video explaining in a non-technical language the value proposition of these innovations to the potential customers.
