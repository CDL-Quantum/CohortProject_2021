## Project 1: Quantum Advantage with Trapped Ions 

This project will guide you through the recent Google quantum supremacy result, and its possible implementation using near-term quantum computers built with trapped ions.

Open up [instructions.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week1_Trapped_Ions/instructions.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

Please edit this markdown file directly with links to your completed tasks and challenges.  

## Tasks include:
* Simulating a random circuit with a Matrix Product State code, and producing a speckle pattern.
* Adding a single bit-flip error and exploring the change in the speckle pattern.
* Exploring convergence of the Porter-Thomas Distribution.
* Exploring the effect of 2-qubit gate errors.
* Describe a business that could be build around random circuits.  (See below Business Application)

## Further Challenges:
* Animate your speckle pattern.
* Reproduce the Google cross entropy results.
* Implement this circuit on a real trapped ion computer!

## Solutions

All solution in Julia can be found in [this notebook](./solution_julia.ipynb). We've also created an analogous [notebook](./solutions_python.ipynb) in python in for those who are more familiar the language.

### Task 1: Plot the probability of each bit string for various circuit widths and depths

We implemented the rotation gates and sampled the outputs from the quantum circuit to obtain a random distribution of bit string probabilities. In the Julia implementation, we chose to test combinations of 4, 8, 12 qubits with varying depths of 1, 256 and 512 gates. We generated speckle patterns of each combination which is shown here in the following figure.

### Task 2: Adding random bit flip errors

We modified the circuits in the notebooks to randomly generate bit flip errors. We demonstrate that this substantially changes the probability distributions by plotting the speckle patterns for 9 different iterations. This yields completely random distributions which is shown in the following animation:

We demonstrate the same animation in a single figure shown here:

We also show another set as a collection of line graphs:

And checkout out this heatmap displaying the random probabilities:

### Bonus: Implement the circuit on a real trapped ion computer

We implemented the random circuit on the IonQ trapped ion computer by connecting to their API. We built a sweet NodeJs repository to be able to so with simple commands via the command line. Checkout the repo's [README](./ionq-implementation/README.md) for more information. 

We could choose to implement the circuit on their quantum machine or a simulator. So we did both. Unfortunately, the results from the quantum machine was not very precise and only gave us up to 3 decimal places in precision (we are on the free plan), so the plots may be a little crude. 

Here are the probability distributions for an 8 qubit system on a 512 deep circuit on the trapped ion machine:

Next we tried to replicate the analysis in task 3 by showing that the cumulative distribution function of p would tend to the Porter-Thomas (exponential) distribution. Recall though, that the low precision of the free tier yielded very choppy graphs:

![QPU CDF](../Week1_Trapped_Ions/img/qpu-cdf-deep.png)

Compared to the true Porter-Thomas (exponential) distribution: 

![QPU True CDF](../Week1_Trapped_Ions/img/qpu-true-cdf-deep.png)

Due to the coarseness of the predictions, we tried the simulator with a higher precision of 9 decimal places. To replicate the work in task 3, we first tried a circuit of depth 1 as shown here: 

![Simulator depth 1 CDF](../Week1_Trapped_Ions/img/simulator-cdf-shallow.png)

And by increasing the depth we achieved a very similar CDF to the Porter-Thomas distribution: 

![Simulator depth 1 CDF](../Week1_Trapped_Ions/img/simulator-cdf-deep.png)

Which can be compared to the true Porter-Thomas distribution shown here:

## Business Application
For each week, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

* Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
* Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
* Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
* Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.

For more details refer to the [Business Application found here](./Business_Application.md)
