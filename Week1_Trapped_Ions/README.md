## Project 1: Quantum Advantage with Trapped Ions 

This project will guide you through the recent Google quantum supremacy result, and its possible implementation using near-term quantum computers built with trapped ions.

Open up [instructions.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week1_Trapped_Ions/instructions.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

## Tasks include:
* Simulating a random circuit with a Matrix Product State code, and producing a speckle pattern.
* Adding a single bit-flip error and exploring the change in the speckle pattern.
* Exploring convergence of the Porter-Thomas Distribution.
* Exploring the effect of 2-qubit gate errors.
* Describe a business that could be build around random circuits.  (See below Business Application)

## Summary of Results
### [Task 3](./Task3.ipynb): Emperical Cumulative Distribution of Random Circuit Sampling Probabilities

## Further Challenges:
* Animate your speckle pattern.
* Reproduce the Google cross entropy results.
* Implement this circuit on a real trapped ion computer!


## Business Application
An interesting application of random circuit sampling addressed in this cohort project is secure communication. The communication protocol can be used by any individuals, companies, governments, and militaries demanding high-level communication security. We provide more detailed description about the business application [here](./Business_Application_Team23.md)
