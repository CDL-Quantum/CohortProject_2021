## Project 1: Quantum Advantage with Trapped Ions 

This project will guide you through the recent Google quantum supremacy result, and its possible implementation using near-term quantum computers built with trapped ions.

Open up [instructions.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2021/tree/main/Week1_Trapped_Ions/instructions.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

Please edit this markdown file directly with links to your completed tasks and challenges.  

## Tasks include:
* Simulating a random circuit with a Matrix Product State code, and producing a speckle pattern.
* Adding a single bit-flip error and exploring the change in the speckle pattern.
* Exploring convergence of the Porter-Thomas Distribution.
* Exploring the effect of 2-qubit gate errors.
* Describe a business that could be build around random circuits.  (See below Business Application)

## Further Challenges:
* Animate your speckle pattern.
* Reproduce the Google cross entropy results.
* Implement this circuit on a real trapped ion computer!


## Business Application
For each week, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

* Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
* Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
* Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
* Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.

For more details refer to the [Business Application found here](./Business_Application.md)
