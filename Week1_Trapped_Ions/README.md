## Project 1: Quantum Advantage with Trapped Ions 

Our first week's project will guide you through the recent Google quantum supremacy result, and its possible implementation using near-term quantum computers built with trapped ions.

In this project we try to investigate the quantum supremacy result reported by Google and show how it might be implemented using a trapped ion device.


## Tasks summaries:

1. Simulating a random circuit with a Matrix Product State code, and producing a speckle pattern.
2. Adding a single bit-flip error and exploring the change in the speckle pattern.
3. Exploring convergence of the Porter-Thomas Distribution.
4. Exploring the effect of 2-qubit gate errors.
5. Describe a business that could be build around random circuits.  (See below Business Application)

## Business Application

From the business perspective, we first provide a non-technical description of the problem. Secondly, we identify potential real-world problems to be solved using the above methods. We also identify potential customers that would benefit from the innovations, e.g. companies that would consider paying to have this problem solved. Finally, we present a short video-presentation that explains the value proposition of these innovations to the potential customers.
