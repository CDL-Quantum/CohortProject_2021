Setuping Julia Environment:

1. Download Julia (For Mac users, brew install --cask julia)
2. Install IJulia which will create a Ijupyter notebook with julia compiler.
- Follow the instructions provided by IJulia https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl.
3. Install PastaQ, since pastaQ uses Itensor, we only need to install pastaQ
- Inside the julia REPL, which can be access just typing julia in the terminal, type ], which will open the package manager.
- type add PastaQ and hit enter
4. Once it finishes download, just enter `using IJulia` and then the `notebook()` commands in the julia REPL and you're good to go
