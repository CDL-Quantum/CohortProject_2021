# Source of quantum randomness

## Summary of the technical problem solved in this exercise
The focus of this Project is to study quantum random circuits. Using a random number generator, different layers of quantum gates are generated, obtaining random circuits to be applied to a fixed initial state. For each of the output states obtained after applying each circuit, we get samples to obtain the probability distribution of the different measurement outcomes.

It turns out that the probability distributions obtained in this way display a complex behavior, and are very sensitive to changes in the random circuits. We have studied this for different scenarios, including noise implemented by a randomly-applied bit flip.

## Examples of real-world problems related to our solutions

#### Quantum cryptography:
  >Random quantum circuits are fundamental in quantum data hiding and quantum cryptography.
  
#### Quantum supremacy:
  >Algorithms based on quantum sampling offer a new opportunity to demonstrate quantum computation advantages in near-term quantum computing devices, since it is believed that there is no efficient classical algorithm to simulate the sampling of certain quantum circuits. This is a crucial step in the development of a new generation of computers. 
  
#### Certified quantum randomness:

>The production of certifiable randomness based on the evaluation of random quantum circuits can be of interest for different industrial and commercial activities that rely on the assumption that certain bit strings are truly random.
 

## Potential customers for the utilization of our solution approach:
There is an important sector of private and public institutions and organizations which carry out several activities that rely on the use of certified randomness. Among them, one can find security, defense, research, commerce and testing of products. In particular, the game industry makes use of random number generators.

As expected, the number of targeted attacks and breaches against gaming machines and applications increases with time, given that the development of computing technologies and algorithms offer new tools for eventual hackers to break in. In this context, Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs) find increasing challenges in the task of fulfilling the security requirements of the gaming industry. This observation also holds true for the security industry, which is of interest for political and governmental organizations.

The task of obtaining certified randomness is even more challenging for the different institutions and companies in developing countries. As an example, a Casino of Buenos Aires bought a quantum random number generator from a swiss company.

Thus, there is a growing interest in the development of regional companies that can supply the public and private sector in the Latinamerican region, offering alternative prices and locally-produced solutions, which is especially important for the public sector. Also public and private universities can benefit from such quantum random generators produced locally.

We can conclude that
1) Different agencies want to ensure beyond reasonable doubt that they are using true random sequences.
2) This is very important in the game, commerce and security industries to maintain the prestige of their products and services.
3) Attacks can also have a high reputational damage not only for political and governmental organizations, but also in the game industry and in bank and commerce activities.
4) It is very important to have local suppliers in developing countries for the whole market development, specially for governmental agencies and companies.
