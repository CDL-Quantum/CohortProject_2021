## Quantum Bootcamp Cohort Project 2021

The 2021 Cohort Project is an online collaboration bringing together founders in a series of open-source challenges.
During the four-week bootcamp, the cohort will be split into teams.  These teams will compete on a set of challenges 
designed to engage their science, technology, and business skills on problems related to quantum entrepreneurship.
This year's challenges will focus on Quantum Simulators.

### Goals:  
* Technical: To explore current and near-term quantum simulation hardware and data.
* Business: To communicate the results of the collaboration, and to imagine possible uses of the technology as a solution to a real-world customer.

### Project Legacy:
The Cohort Project is open source, and hosted on GitHub. Each Monday at 8:00am EST the teams will 
[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-forks) 
this repository to their own GitHub account to begin work on the challenges.  By Saturday at 11:59pm EST each team must issue a pull request with their final entry. CDL will review the pull requests, and choose one team's work to merge into the main upstream repository. From that point on it will become part of the legacy of the 2021 Boot Camp.
